# News-Research-Tool-Project
I built a News Research Tool with Streamlit and LangChain that fetches news articles from URLs, processes them with text splitting and embeddings, and stores them in a FAISS vector DB. Users can query articles via a RetrievalQA chain to get precise, source-backed insightsâ€”showcasing my skills in LLMs and vector search.
